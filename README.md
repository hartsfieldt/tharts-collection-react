# Pro Portfolio

This is a portfolio that showcases my skills in both designing and developing websites. It's built with JavaScript using JSX, Node and React.

The website has four sections: About me, My Work, My Resume and Contact. Pages are separated into their own components and rendered conditionally by React according to which the user clicks.

You can find the page live [here](http://hartsfieldt.github.io/tharts-collection-react).
